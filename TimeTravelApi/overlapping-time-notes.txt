There is a problem that if a shorter request that started after and finished before my request...
If that shorter one expires before I do, the clock gets reset while I am asleep.
But this means that when we're trying to calculate time difference in AlertProcessor.GetTimeDifferenceSinceRequest...
...we use the adjusted current time to calculate how long it is since my request started.
So if time was adjusted by 20 mins while I was asleep and I asked for 60 minutes, I'll actually get 80 minutes instead.
I think the solution is to note what the timeAdjustment was at the point that I was created, and store this on MoreTimeRequest.
Then AlertProcessor.GetTimeDifferenceSinceRequest should use THAT adjustment onto clock.Now, 
instead of whatever the current adjustment is.
