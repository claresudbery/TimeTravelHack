As with current code : 
find all events which expire now 
Mark them all expired 
Time adjustment is longest time 
New:
Look for all outstanding unexpired events and subtract time adjustment from their length. 
If adjustment > length, change length to 0. If length is now 0, Mark as expired.

Do we have a test yet for when another request has expired but we are not expired yet? Clock should be adjusted. 

Do we have a test yet for when other requests expired before we even started? Oh hang on, should our "start time" already contain previous adjustments??
